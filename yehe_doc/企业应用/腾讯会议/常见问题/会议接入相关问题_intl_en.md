**What are the differences between instant video conferences and scheduled video conferences?**

| Type | Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scheduled video conferences | You need to enter details to set up the video conference. A scheduled video conference will be retained for 30 days. You can join the video conference anytime during the 30 days. |
| Instant video conferences | You do not need to enter any details to set up the video conference. An instant video conference is retained for 1 hour. If no one is in the video conference, VooV Meeting ends the video conference after 1 hour. |

**How do I transfer my host permission to another attendee?**

Click **Attendees** after joining the video conference, select the attendee to whom you want to transfer the host permission, and click **More**. In the displayed dialog box, select **Make Host**.

**What should I do if I need to join a video conference with a bad network connection?**

Click **Settings** after joining the video conference and enable audio mode to reduce the network load. We recommend switching to a better network environment to avoid a bad video conferencing experience.

**Can I start multiple video conferences at the same time with the same account?**

 1. You can sign in using the same account on different clients, such as macOS, iOS, and Android at the same time and start separate video conferences as the host on each client.

 2. You cannot sign in with the same account on two identical clients at the same time. For example, you cannot sign in to another Windows device if you were already logged in with a Windows device. You will be kicked out from the first device. 

**How do I hold an instant video conference in VooV Meeting?**

After you log in to VooV Meeting, click **Start** on the home page. You will start a video conference immediately. There is no need to enter any additional information. You cannot start and host video conferences without logging in to VooV Meeting.

**Why do I get a message saying "Please log in first" when I try to join a meeting using a guest account?**
You may be joining a meeting with Tencent Meeting users. Under applicable laws and regulations, all such users, including VooV Meeting users, must sign up and log in to join meetings with Tencent Meeting users.
