If your account has negative available credit, you need to top up before you can purchase new Tencent Cloud services. Most Tencent Cloud services are billed hourly. If your available credit remains negative, services may be suspended for your account. To avoid service suspension, we recommend you keep your available credit positive. You can top up by **credit card** or via **bank transfer**.

For data security, only account creators and collaborators with financial permissions have access to the **Payment** page.

### Top up by credit card
1. Log in to the console and go to **Billing Center** > **Payment Management** > **Payment**. Enter the top-up amount and payment account and click **Pay Now**.

2. To avoid duplicate payments, if you top up the same amount twice within one minute, a confirmation window will pop up asking you to confirm.
