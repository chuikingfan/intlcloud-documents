 (g) <u>Independent Allocations of Risk.</u> EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THESE TERMS BETWEEN YOU AND TENCENT. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE FEES CHARGED BY TENCENT TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND TENCENT. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, AND EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE LIMITED REMEDIES IN THESE TERMS HAVE FAILED OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

 **12. TRADE COMPLIANCE**

(a) <u>Your Status.</u> You represent and warrant that neither you, nor any of your oﬃcers, directors, shareholders, agents or employees, are:

 (b) <u>Sanctions Event.</u> If you become a Restricted Person or controlled or owned by 50% or more (directly or indirectly) in the aggregate, by one or more Restricted Person; if provision of or use of the Services becomes otherwise restricted or prohibited as a consequence of the imposition of sanctions or by operation of Trade Laws (as defined below); or if Tencent reasonably believes that you are in violation of Trade Laws or are engaging in activities that would risk placing Tencent in breach of any Trade Laws (a “**Sanctions Event**”), Tencent shall not be obliged to perform any of its obligations under these Terms or continue to provide the Services and shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to terminate these Terms and the provision of the Services with immediate eﬀect. Tencent is also entitled to take any other remedial actions at the discretion of Tencent.

 (c) <u>Trade Compliance.</u> In connection with your use of the Services, you will comply with all applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations (collectively, “**Trade Laws**”). You agree not to engage in any activities in connection with the use of the Services that would violate Trade Laws or that would risk placing Tencent in breach of any Trade Laws.

Upon such assignment or transfer taking effect, the successor or permitted assigns (as the case may be) shall assume assignor/transferor’s liability and assignor/transferor is released from the same. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing restriction will be void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding upon and inure to the beneﬁt of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.

 (c) <u>Consent to Electronic Communications.</u> By using the Services, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically, whether by e-mail, through the Services platform, or otherwise, will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.

 (d) <u> Force Majeure.</u> If the performance of these Terms is prevented, delayed, hindered or restricted, or Tencent breaches these Terms due to an event of force majeure, including but not limited to: (i) natural disasters; (ii) acts of government; (iii)  promulgation or change of laws, regulations or policies (including Trade Laws, sanctions, restrictive measures or regulations); (iv) strikes or unrest; or (v) any significant change of circumstances (including changes in applicable laws which would render provision of Services potentially illegal or different from that contemplated by the parties at time of the acceptance of these Terms or ﬁrst download, install, access, or use the Services), foreseeable or otherwise, in no case shall Tencent be liable for the breach of these Terms, or be otherwise liable for any such failure or delay in the performance of such obligations. If any of the abovementioned events persists for more than 15 calendar days, Tencent may terminate these Terms, without assuming any liability, by immediate written notice to you.
 
 (e) <u>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.</u> Except as provided in the North America Terms, EEA Consumer Terms, PRC Service Region Terms, Germany Terms, South Korea Terms or other region-specific or Service-specific terms, any claims for equitable relief may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction even if the parties have chosen an exclusive venue below.

Unless the North America Terms, EEA Consumer Terms, PRC Service Region Terms, Germany Terms South Korea Terms or other region-specific or Service-specific terms specify otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services, will be resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted. The seat of the arbitration will be Singapore and the language will be English. All proceedings will be conﬁdential and there will be one arbitrator only.

 (f) <u>Waiver and Severability.</u> The waiver by either party of any breach of these Terms does not waive any other breach. Neither party will be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under these Terms. If any part of these Terms is unenforceable, the remaining portions of these Terms will remain in full force and eﬀect.

 (g) <u>No Third-Party Beneﬁciaries.</u> These Terms are not intended to confer any beneﬁts on any third party except to the extent that it expressly states that it does. End Users are not third party beneﬁciaries to these Terms.

 (h) <u>Entire Agreement.</u> These Terms and the Additional Terms are the ﬁnal and complete expression of all agreements between you and Tencent regarding their subject matter and supersede all prior oral and written agreements regarding these matters. The Additional Terms referred to in these Terms are incorporated by this reference. In the event of any conﬂict between the Terms and the Additional Terms, the inconsistency shall be resolved by giving preference to the following in the order that they are listed: (i) the Data Processing and Security Agreement (which shall govern with respect to processing of Personal Data as applicable to the relevant Services); (ii) these Terms; and (iii) the Additional Terms, provided, however, that the terms and conditions of the PRC Service Region Terms, the North America Terms, the EEA Consumer Terms, Germany Terms, South Korea Terms or other region-specific terms will govern with respect to the Services, if applicable. Tencent shall not be bound by any term which is different from, modifies or otherwise in addition to the terms of these Terms, unless modified in accordance with these Terms, or otherwise agreed in writing. Where applicable, if you enter into a separate service agreement with Tencent in respect of the Services, and where expressly provided by that service agreement, the terms of the service agreement shall prevail to the extent that there is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of that service agreement and these Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that any terms and conditions in any customer-issued purchasing forms, request for proposal, vendor questionnaire or similar shall not apply and Tencent disclaims the same.   

 (i) <u>Modiﬁcation of these Terms, the Privacy Policy and the Cookies Policy.</u> Tencent may amend these Terms, including the Additional Terms, from time to time by posting updated versions to the Tencent Cloud site. Unless specifically provided in these Terms or the Additional Terms, or otherwise indicated by Tencent, the amended terms will take effect within 30 calendar days after they are posted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any changes relating to Tencent’s Services or product functionalities shall take effect immediately. Tencent will use reasonable eﬀorts to notify you of the changes, but you are responsible for periodically checking these Terms, including the Additional Terms, for any modiﬁcations. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any amended Terms. Amended terms are not applicable retroactively.
 
 (j) <u>Language.</u> All communications and notices in relation to these Terms shall be made or given in either English or Chinese. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any translations of these Terms are made, the English version shall prevail.

Except as otherwise permitted by law, you shall not issue any press release or make any other public communication with respect to these Terms, or the fact that Tencent is providing Services for you.

Your use of the Tencent Marks shall be subject to any terms, conditions, or guidelines that Tencent may issue from time to time.
 
 (l) <u>Notice.</u> Any notice required or permitted to be given under these Terms will be effective if it is in writing and sent by certified or registered mail, or insured courier, return receipt requested, to the appropriate party at the address set forth above (in the case of Tencent) and the registered billing address or any other address registered with us (in your case) and with the appropriate postage affixed. Either party may change its address for receipt of notice by notice to the other party in accordance with this Section.

Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to the Terms. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.

(c) Tencent will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The arbitration tribunal will consist of three arbitrators to be appointed in accordance with the Rules. Arbitration will be conducted in English. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) YOU AND TENCENT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Tencent agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

**2. Third Party Connectivity Services** 

The Services provided to you may include broadband data connectivity services that connect your location(s) to Tencent Cloud (the “Third Party Connectivity Services”).
