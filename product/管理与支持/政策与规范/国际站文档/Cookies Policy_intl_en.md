## **1.** **What are cookies?**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your browser or device when you visit a certain web address. Cookies are then sent back to the originating web address on each subsequent visit, or to another web address that recognises that cookie. Cookies are widely used in order to make the Service work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the Service team.

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your log-in and preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have accessed or used the Service before or whether you are a new visitor or user. They can also help to ensure that advertising you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. Cookies can help us safeguard the security of our data and services and detect the cheating, hacking and fraud against our products and services. For instance, cookies can store ticket information, which can be used by the server to verify if the log-in is made by yourself independently. The encrypted information in the ticket can also be used to prevent a variety of types of attacks, cross-site information theft, and access with disguised identity. 

There are two broad categories of cookies:

 - **First party cookies,** served directly by us to your device.

 - **Third party cookies,** which are served by a third party on our behalf. 

Cookies can remain on your browser or device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they exist only while your browser or application is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser or application. Other cookies are 'permanent cookies', meaning that they survive after your browser or application is closed. They can be used by the Service to recognise your device when you visit and use the Service again.

 

## **2.** **How do we use cookies?**

We use cookies to:

 - verify log-in information to ensure the security of your account;

 - track traffic flow and patterns of travel in connection with the Service;

 - understand the total number of visitors to the Service on an ongoing basis and the types of devices; 

 - monitor the performance of the Service to continually improve it;

 - improve our products and services and provide reference data for the research and development of new products or functions; and

 - customize and enhance your online experience.

## **3.** **What types of cookies do we use?**
